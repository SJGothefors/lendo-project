## improvements to make
*if i had more time, I would*

- add tests (not that familiar with testing in frontend, so will have to learn).
- use routing to navigate between pages instead of using states and then hide/show components.
- add a loading spinner when fetching data.
- improve the mocking to use mock library.
- investigate the magical glitch that sometimes, when its two variants available, there is a extra space between the products cards.
