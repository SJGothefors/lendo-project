## improvements to make
*if i had more time to invest, I would*

- add tests (not that familiar with testing in frontend, so will have to learn how its done in the current app setup).
- use routing to navigate between pages instead of using states and then hide/show components.
- add a loading spinner when fetching data.
- improve the mocking to use mock library.
- investigate the magical glitch that sometimes, when its two variants available, there is a extra space between the products cards.
- Refactor the item with info and variant information to a single component. As it is now its a bit duplicated code between the components when its in the cart and when its in the checkout and confirmation.
